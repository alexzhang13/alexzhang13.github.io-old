<h4>AI/ML</h4>
<ul>
<li> 
        <a href="https://alexzhang13.github.io/assets/pdfs/Reward_Shaping_LLM.pdf">A Simple Framework for Intrinsic Reward-Shaping for Reinforcement Learning using LLM Feedback</a>
        <p style="margin-left: 25px;">
        Using large language models to generate reward function code to improve sample efficiency and inject external wiki knowledge into reinforcement learning algorithms. Run a simple set of downstream experiments on Pokemon Showdown. 
        </p>
</li>
<li> 
        <a href="https://alexzhang13.github.io/assets/pdfs/Pruning_KMatrix_AZ.pdf">Pruning Methods with Sparse Factorizations of Neural Networks</a>
        <p style="margin-left: 25px;">
        Examining known pre-initialization pruning methods with <a href="https://dawn.cs.stanford.edu/2019/06/13/butterfly/">Butterfly Matrix</a> layers and the effect on memory reduction and model inference speed.
        </p>
</li>
<li> 
        <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11427">Appearance Codes using Joint Embedding Learning of Multiple Modalities</a>
        <p style="margin-left: 25px;">
        Neat method for avoiding inference-time compute of appearance codes. We use small VAEs to learn these embeddings, but the method can easily be extended given a larger compute budget to more modern neural rendering methods.
        </p>

<li>
        <a href="https://alexzhang13.github.io/assets/pdfs/Futures.pdf"> 
        Predicting Visual Futures with Image Captioning and Pre-Trained Language Models </a> 
        <p style="margin-left: 25px;">
        Freshman year research on leveraging image captioning model in a visual prediction task in the PNLP lab that was ultimately canned.
        </p>

<h4>Math Stuff</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06769">Transaction Fee Mining and Mechanism Design</a>
</li>
<p style="margin-left: 25px;">
Survey paper on incentive compatibility in transaction fee schemes on the blockchain and known transaction fee mechanisms. 
</p>

<li>
        <a href="https://alexzhang13.github.io/assets/pdfs/No_Clone_Theorem.pdf">Quantum Information Theory and the No-Cloning Theorem</a>
        </li>
        <p style="margin-left: 25px;">
        Basic tensor product proof of no-cloning theorem in Quantum Information Theory using tools from linear algebra.
