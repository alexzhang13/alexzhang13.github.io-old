Hey! I'm a fourth year undergraduate student at Princeton University studying computer science and
math. My research interests center around discovering techniques for <b>grounding agent behavior in
different data modalities</b> (e.g. language, visual) to create more reliable, interpretable, and
less data hungry AI models.

<ul> <li>I primarily have been working in the <a href="http://nlp.cs.princeton.edu/">Princeton
NLP</a> group (now the <a href="https://pli.princeton.edu"> Princeton Language and Intelligence
group </a>), and I am fortunate enough to be advised by Professor <a
href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~karthikn/">Karthik Narasimhan</a>, Dr. <a
href="https://machineslearner.com">Khanh Nguyen</a>, and Professor <a
href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~li/">Kai Li</a>. </li>

<li>I also <b>co-founded</b> and am the <b>president</b> of <a
href="https://ai-house.vercel.app">AI@Princeton</a>, the undergraduate AI student organization at
Princeton, where I have lectured on dozens of topics including large language models, diffusion
models and generative AI, machine learning theory, and GPU/TPU processors. We also launched and
directed the first <a href="https://ai-house.vercel.app/Framework/aitt.html">AI Tiger Trek</a>,
where we took 12 passionate Princeton students to San Francisco to meet prominent professors,
entrepreneurs, and researchers in the field of AI! </li>

</ul>
Finally, I'm currently **reading through all 3584 abstracts from NeurIPS 2023** and am compiling a
post about it.
I've also recently been trying to keep track of my notes and papers I've read in the past. For now,
I've been keeping a list of papers on [World
Models](https://github.com/alexzhang13/world-models-papers/). Feel free to reach out to talk through
my email at [x]@princeton.edu where [x]=alzhang. 

<em>otherwise, i'm still grinding sidequests in [xenoblade
