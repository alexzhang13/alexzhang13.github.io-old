Hey! I recently graduated from Princeton University studying computer science and
math. There, I received the <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/news/class-day-department-celebrates-accomplishments-graduates">Phillip Goldman '86 Senior Prize</a> in Computer Science, which is the CS department's highest academic honor awarded to a single student. I was also awarded the Outstanding Senior Thesis Prize for my work on augmenting decision-making agents with language capabilities.

Right now, I'm particularly interested in understanding <b><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17593">grounding</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04449">guiding</a> agent behavior in different data modalities</b> to create more reliable, interpretable, and less data hungry AI models. I'm also very interested in <b>efficient <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135">training</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01318">inference</a> of AI models</b> at a systems-level, particularly for generative models.

<ul> <li>I am fortunate enough to be advised by Professor <a
href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~karthikn/">Karthik Narasimhan</a>, Dr. <a
href="https://machineslearner.com">Khanh Nguyen</a>, and Professor <a
href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~li/">Kai Li</a>. </li>

<li>I also <b>co-founded</b> and am the <b>president</b> of <a
href="https://ai-house.vercel.app">AI@Princeton</a>, the undergraduate AI student organization at
Princeton. I also helped organize the first <a href="https://ai-house.vercel.app/Framework/aitt.html">AI Tiger Trek</a>. </li>
</ul>

<!-- I really enjoy teaching, and I've TA'd quite a few courses at Princeton. Currently, I'm the undergraduate course assistant (UCA) creating the assignments for the new <a href="https://ben-eysenbach.github.io/intro-rl/">Intro to Reinforcement Learning (COS435/ECE433)</a> course being taught in Spring 2024 at Princeton. -->


Finally, I just finished **reading through all 3584 abstracts from NeurIPS 2023** and have <a href="https://alexzhang13.github.io/blog/2024/neurips2023/">compiled my notes here</a>.
I also keep a list of papers on [World
Models](https://github.com/alexzhang13/world-models-papers/). Feel free to reach out to talk through
my email at [x]@princeton.edu where [x]=alzhang. 

<em>otherwise, i'm still grinding sidequests in [xenoblade
